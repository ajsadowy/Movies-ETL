## Purpose   
The purpose for this activity was to get some familiarity with the ETL (extract, transform, and load) process of large and overwhelming data files. Utilizing data from Wikipedia, Kaggle metadata, and MovieLens rating data, I began writing an ETL function to read the three data sources, then extracting and transforming the Wikipedia data and Kaggle data to load into a database through SQL server. Once the data was loaded to the data base, conducting queries to retrieve specific information was much easier to achieve.
